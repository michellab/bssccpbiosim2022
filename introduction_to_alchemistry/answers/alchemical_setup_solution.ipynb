    "It is good practice to minimise and equilibrate the molecular system _before_ setting up the free energy simulations. Thankfully BiomSpace can handle systems containing perturbable molecules for simulation protocols other than `BioSimSpace.Protocol.FreeEnergy`. For example, this means that you can create a process to minimise a specified end state (lambda = 0 by default) of a perturbable system. In the box below, write some code to run a minmisation and equilibration on the system (`complx`).\n",
