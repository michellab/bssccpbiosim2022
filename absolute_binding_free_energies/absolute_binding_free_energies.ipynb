Among other issues, without restraints the ligand would float away from the binding site as the ligand's intermolecular interactions were removed. In order to obtain converged free energies of binding, we would have to be sure that the ligand was sampling outside the binding site as soon as this became thermodynamically favourable, and that we were correctly estimating the ratios of the sizes of the simulation box to the binding site; in practice, this is not feasible.\n",

    "The performance of ABFE calculations can be highly dependent on the restraints used. Considering the simulations connecting states 6 and 7 (see cycle above), we would like the restraints to be weak, so that the unrestrained complex is minimally perturbed and convergence is quickly achieved. However, the fastest convergence of the simulations connecting stages 4, 5, and 6 will likely be achieved by using relatively strong restraints to restrict the configurational volume which must be sampled as much as possible. We can strike a compromise between these opposing requirements by selecting the restraints to mimic native protein-ligand interactions as closely as possible, which allows us to find the strongest possible restraints which minimally perturb the unrestrained fully interacting state.\n",

    "In addition, Boresch restraints have instabilites which are most commonly encountered when any of the contiguous anchor points are close to collinear. This results in large fluctuations in the dihedral angles and the application of large torques through the dihedral restraints - this can \"blow-up\" the molecular dynamics integrator, causing the simulation to crash. So, we must be careful to avoid such poor selections when choosing our restraint. \n",
